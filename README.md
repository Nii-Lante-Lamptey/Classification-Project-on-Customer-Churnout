Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn: Uncovering Key Indicators and Retention Strategies

Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition or customer turnover, refers to the percentage of customers who cease using a company's product or service within a given timeframe. Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for organizations as it directly impacts their profitability and growth. By identifying the factors that contribute to churn, businesses can develop effective retention strategies to mitigate this problem.

In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing various customer attributes such as gender, age, partner status, internet service provider, contract term, and payment method, among others. We aim to explore the relationship between these attributes and the likelihood of customer churn. By conducting a thorough analysis, we can uncover key indicators of churn and identify patterns that indicate a higher propensity for customers to leave the organization.

Objectives

1.Build a classification model to predict customer churn and assess the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization.

2.Identify key indicators or factors that contribute to customer churn.

3.Formulate effective retention strategies based on the identified indicators to mitigate customer attrition.

Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the various customer attributes and the likelihood of customer churn.

Alternate Hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between the various customer attributes and the likelihood of customer churn.



Questions

1.What are the significant factors that influence customer churn?

2.Can we accurately predict customer churn based on available customer data?

3.How can we use the identified indicators to develop effective retention strategies?

4.Which customer segments are more likely to churn?

5.How can the organization leverage payment methods, contract terms, and billing preferences to reduce churn?
